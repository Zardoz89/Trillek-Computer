Generic Western/Latin Keyboard controller
================
Version 0.7.0

Generic Keyboard controller. Handles an internal buffer to store key events.

 - Device Type     : 0x03 (HID)
 - Device SubType  : 0x01 (Western/Latin Keyboard)
 - Device Builder  : 0x00000000
 - Device ID       : 0x01 (Generic Keyboard standard)


RESOURCES
---------

The keyboard controller uses few commands to see the status of the keyboard,
the key buffer and manipulate the key buffer.

COMMANDS
--------


 - 0x0000 : **CLR-BUFF** :
   Clears the key buffer.
 - 0x0001 : **POP-KEY** :
   Pop the key buffer. Sets C register to the status bits of the key event, 
   sets B register to the scancode and sets A register to key-code (Latin-1 
   encoding).
 - 0x0002 : **PUSH-KEY** :
   Push the key buffer. C register must have the status bits, B register must 
   be the scancode and A register must have the key-code.
 - 0x0003 : **SET-INT** :
   Sets interrupt message to A register value. If A is 0x0000, then disables
   Key event interrupt. This is set to 0 when the computer boots.

HOW WORKS
---------

The Keyboard controller have a internal ring buffer that stores a
"keyboard event" when a user types a key. Each entry of the buffer contains
information of the key pressed and if was any function key pressed at same time.
When we pull a key event from the buffer, we get the **scancode** and the **key-code** 
of the event, plus status bits.

**Scancodes** represents what physical physical key was pressed. This scancodes 
are usually refereed against a US English keyboard for reference. For example 
scancode 0x002F is the key that in a US keyboard is a semicolon symbol, so we 
call these key "semicolon". Scancodes are 16 bit values.

**Key-codes** represents the translation of the pressed key to [Latin-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1)
(8bit ASCII) applying on it effects like Shift, uppercasing, localization of the
keyboard layout (for example : 'ñ' or 'ç'), etc... Key-codes are usually more 
useful when we are processing text input. Key-codes are 8 bit values.

In addition to the commands, reading **E hardware register** returns always 
the number of key events stored in the key buffer.  

### Status Bits

Status bits (D register and C register value on PULL/PUSH-KEY) have this format :

    15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
    -----------------------------------------------
     0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  G  C  S

Were **G** is 1 if "Alt. Gr." key is pressed, **C** is 1 if "Control" key is pressed
 and **S** is 1 if "Shift" key is pressed.


### Events buffer
The buffer can store at least 64 events. Each time that a key is typed, the
appropriate event is pushed to the buffer.
The buffer operates in FIFO fashion. So when a user types a key, a new event is
inserted in the buffer. Using **POP-KEY** extracts the most old event stored 
in the buffer (POP buffer), but using **PUSH-KEY** inserts a new event in the 
buffer like if it was the oldest entry (PUSH buffer). If there is not enough 
space, pushing fails silently. When the buffer fills and the keyboard inserts a
new event, the most oldest event is removed to allow to insert a new event.
