5.25" Floppy Drive
==================
Version 0.2.3

Name: 5.25" Floppy Drive (5FDD) 

 - Device Types    : 0x08 (Mass Storage Device)
 - Device SubType  : 0x01 (Floppy Drive)
 - Device Builder  : 0x00000000
 - Device ID       : 0x01

The 5.25" Floppy Drive is compatible with all standard 5.25" floppy 
disks.
The 5FDD works is asynchronous, and has a raw transfer1 speed of 100kbit/s. 

### Floppy geometry

The floppies are divided in sides, tracks and sectors (CHS). Can ahve 1 or 2 
sides, or *Heads*, 40 or 80 tracks, or *Cylinders*, and 8 to 36 sectors per 
track. Each sector have asize of 512 Bytes. To calculate the floppy size 
based in his CHS paramters, we do a simple arithmetic :
```
  Size = Sides *  Tracks  * Sectors per Track * 512 B
       = Heads * Cylindes * Sectors per Track * 512 B
```
By nomenclature and convention, *Heads* and *Cyclenders* begin in 0, and 
*Sectors* begin to count from 1. 

Any absolute sector could be be pointed by a CHS value.

 Sides | Sectors Per Track | Tracks Per Side | Capacity 
:-----:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|:----------
   1   |        8          |       40        |  160 KiB
   2   |        8          |       40        |  320 KiB
   1   |        8          |       80        |  320 KiB

   2   |        8          |       80        |  640 KiB
   2   |        9          |       80        |  720 KiB
   2   |        15         |       80        |  1200 KiB

### Times and Latencies

There is many factors that contribute to the time that takes to read/write a 
sector in a floppy :

- Seek Time : 
  It's the time that takes the floppy drive to change from a trak to 
  another track. This takes *5 ms per track*, so to change from track 5 to track 
  25 takes a seek time of `5 ms * (25-5) = 100 ms`.
- Rotational Latency : 
  The floppy magnetic disc is always rotating at 300 RPM. When it try to read/write a 
  particular sector, these sector could be just bellow the header or in the 
  opossite side of the disk. So the average time that takes seek a sector in a 
  track is ` ( 1 / (300/60)) / 2 = 100 ms`. The worst case, could be 200 ms and
  the best case could be 0ms.
- Access Time : 
  This is the Seek Time + Rotational Latency.

**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES** : We assume a fixed Rotational latency time of 100 ms.


COMMANDS and REGISTERS
----------------------
   
Reading E Register returns always the current error code.
Reading D Register returns always the current status code.

By convention, to store a CHS value in a register, we use this format:
```
    15 14 13 12 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 00
    -----------------------------------------------
     H  C  C  C  C  C  C  C  S  S  S  S  S  S  S  S  
```

 - 0x0000 : **SET_INT** :  
   Set interrupt. Enables interrupts and sets the message to A value if X is 
   anything other than 0. Disables interrupts if A value is 0. When interrupts 
   are enabled, the M5FDD will trigger an interrupt whenever the state or error
   codes changes (E register value).
 - 0x0001 : **READ** :  
   Reads the sector pointerd by the CHS value stored in register C and stores 
   in the RAM starting at address B:A.
   Reading is only possible if the state (D register value) is STATE_READY or 
   STATE_READY_WP before calling this command. D will be set to STATE_BUSY 
   when this command is being executed.
   When the command is executed and the floppy drive is ready, the M5FDD seeks 
   the track and sector, and when find it, reads the desired sector at a 
   100kbit/s, storing it in a internal buffer. When it ends to read the data, 
   copies the internal buffer data to the RAM doing a bulk DMA operation at a 
   rate of 40KB/s (4 bytes every 10 device clock ticks -> 40000 Bytes per 
   second), so a sector takes `0.04096s + 0.0128s ~= 0.0538s` to be read.
   This allow to operate asynchronous and protects against partial reads.
   When the M3FDD ends the whole operation and does it correctly, will change D 
   and E registers to STATE_READY/STATE_READY_WP and ERROR_NONE.
 - 0x0002 : **WRITE** :  
   Writes the sector pointed by the CHS valued stored in C reading it from the 
   RAM at address B:A.
   Writing is only possible if the state (D register value) is STATE_READY 
   before calling this command. D will be set to STATE_BUSY when this command 
   is being executed.
   When the command is executed and the floppy drive is ready, the M5FDD seeks 
   the track and sector at same time that does a bulk DMA transfer from the RAM
   to his internal buffer at a rate of 40KB/s. When ends to copy the data and 
   the seek, then begins to write to the floppy disk from his internal buffer 
   at a rate of 100kbit/s. This allow to operate asynchronous.
   When the M3FDD ends the whole operation and does it correctly, will change D 
   and E registers to STATE_READY and ERROR_NONE.
 - 0x0003 : **QUERY_MEDIA** :  
   Sets register with the value of the floppy geometry:
   - A: Total Sectors
   - B: Most Significant Byte is the number of "Sides" (expect 2 or 1), Least Significant Byte is "Tracks per Side"
   - C: Most Significant Byte is "Sectors per Track", Least Significant Byte is "Bytes per Sector Exponent" (expect 9 -> 
     2^9 = 512 bytes)
